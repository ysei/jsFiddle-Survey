Check how delaying spinner affects duration of the Ajax request.<br/>
In the test user is perceiving two actions starting after a click. Both of 
them have the same duration (0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s, 1.0s or 1.5s). Spinner is 
delayed by a random time chosen from the set of (0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s) and is seen 
only if delay is shorten than the action duration.<br/>
User has to choose which action performed faster and if any action felt
unresponsive. The fact that the actions took the same time is unknown to the 
user.
